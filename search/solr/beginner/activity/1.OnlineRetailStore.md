# Online Retail Platform

## Scenario
You are working for an online retail platform that wants to improve its search functionality using Apache Solr. The platform handles a diverse range of orders with information on products, customers, order dates, categories, and more.

## Tasks

### 1. Document Indexing
- Create a dataset with information on orders, including `order_id`, `product_name`, `customer_name`, `order_date`, `category`, `price`, and `reviews`.
- Index the dataset into Solr to create a searchable index of the platform's order data.

### 2. Basic Querying
- Implement a search interface for users to explore the entire order history.
- Provide a feature to retrieve detailed information about a specific order by its `order_id`.

### 3. Faceting
- Enhance the search interface to display facets, allowing users to filter results based on products, customers, categories, and order dates.
- Display counts for each product, customer, category, and order date in the search results.

### 4. Sorting
- Implement sorting options for search results based on `order_date` and `customer_name`.
- Allow users to toggle between ascending and descending order.

### 5. Filtering
- Provide filters on the search interface to narrow down results by order date, customer, and product category.
- Implement the ability to apply multiple filters simultaneously.

### 6. Deleting Documents
- Implement a feature for administrators to remove outdated or incorrect order entries.
- Demonstrate the impact of deletion through search results.
